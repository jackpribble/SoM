== Seals (御札) ==
Enchanted paper used as a magical catalyst. They can ward off evil or cut like knives.

Also capable of giving severe paper cuts, so handle with care.

== The Fist of God (ゴッド・フィスト) ==
Gold staff topped with an eagle's wings. It was won by Prince Malcolm from Hanada of the empire, and it now used by Ezme.

Good for killing Demon Kings, samurai, and wrestling gorillas.

=== Miscellaneous (その他) ===

== Ashurn: The Master Key (マスター・キー「アッシャーン」) ==
A white glove marked with a ᛞ (dæg) rune on the back. From the wrist springs a length of cloth that wraps about the forearm. It was forged by Becmi Raavenvall, the King's brother in-law and [[Characters:Esmeralda Andegrist|Ezme]]'s uncle. Can absorb a spell (e.g., illusion) into æther for storage, then you can emit it back out later.

Nickname: the "Sorcerer's Glove".

Doesn't actually unlock anything.

== Nereid's Veil (ネーレーイスの首飾り) ==
The necklace is made of large brown lacquered wood beads. In the center is a thin wood seal with blue glyphs in the language of water. The seal bears a prayer that protects against fire. The seal is said to be blessed by the water goddess Undine herself.

* Resist Fire 1
* Vulnerability Water 1
* Immune to Fire (Can only be against one source of damage before Undine has to recharge the blessing.)

== All-Seeing Eye (全能の眼) ==
A beautiful silver tiara decorated with a plethora of diamonds. There is a large sapphire in the center of the tiara that, with the diamonds, looks like a large eye. This artifact is sought by many and is said to allow a woman to see into and control the hearts of men. In Ezme's experience the use of the artifact on a person leaves them with an obsessive fascination with her. Because of this, she only uses it sparingly. When she does employ it though, it has allowed her to have complete control over the actions and thoughts of her victims for a short time.

== Everliving Flame (永遠の焔) ==
A mystical flame prophesied to go out when Salamandra awoke, symbolizing the approach of the apocalypse. Kira and company have managed to preserve it, the flame now housed in their lantern.

Blue seal marked with a rune of water symbolizing the pact with Undine.

One of the 4 great seals that protect the world. Don't break it!
